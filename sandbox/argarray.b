	Shows that bc can be subject to a clash between variables in function
	calls. Seen on my bc under Ubuntu 15.10. bc version is 1.06.95.

	f shows the issue with by-ref argument in the first position.
	g shows the issue with by-ref argument in the second position.
	For the clash to occur:

		- The argument name needs be identical between function definition and
		  function call.

		- In the function call, the argumant must be specified twice, once as
		  the by-ref argument, once as the by-val argument.
