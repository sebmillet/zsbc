=================

As of August 2015:

- Prints a warning if a non void function does not return a value or if a void
  function returns a value.

- Manages break/continue/return statements consistently with where they are
  called from (now: can be invoked anywhere, including, outside of a loop or
  function body)

- gmp uses a different way of reading integers (different from bc'),
  need some checks around (if a wrong int is read, it results in a
  zero value -> should raise an error).

- Implements management of short options concatenation, as now, short options
  are to be provided separately.
