# Check zsbc run time with plenty of variables defined and used.
# In parallel, will also check whether zsbc can cope with
# blocks of instructions that contain millions of lines.
#
# The goal is to verify there is no O(n^2) execution time
# left behind.

#   * WARNING *
#
#   This script makes sense in a very specific environment.
#   I tuned it with my PC so that measures are
#   "not too slow, not too fast" => the 'time' instruction
#   shows interesting results.
#   On my PC it is 8s, 18s and 35 for 2, 4 and 8 million,
#   respectively.
#   Thus I know the execution time is ~O(n).
#   I write "~" because the REAL order must be O(n).ln(n)
#   or the like.
